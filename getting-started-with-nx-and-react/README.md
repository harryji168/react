# Getting Started with Nx and React

This is a companion repo to my LogRocket post on getting started with Nx and React.

The project was built with the Nx CLI and follows the same pattern in the React tutorial at https://nx.dev/latest/react/tutorial/01-create-application

The project has three parts in the `apps` folder:

- `api` is an express backend that the React project calls
- `first-project` is the main React project
- `first-project-e2e` is the Cypress tests for this project

I will update this post with a link to my article once it is published.
